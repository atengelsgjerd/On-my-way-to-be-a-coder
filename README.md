# On-my-way-to-be-a-coder

## Description

This project was created to update the written code the Horiseon Marketing Agency had with semantic language so that it is organized in a way in which it follows accessibility standards so that their website will be optimized for search engines. Alt attributes were also added to all image elements, which will aid in users who have low and/or impaired vision.

The CSS has also been updated accordingly and has been structured to follow the flow of the HTML code.
